# PokemonSimulation
This is an in progress simulation of a pokemon battle. I hope to add a second type at one point and I need to add a couple more things to make it better. I hope to add an AI to it, but I might start out with the opponent randomly selecting moves and then maybe I'll code this in python to write a good AI
